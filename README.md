# DAWGCHECK Trainer — Final Branch Ready

This branch contains the final polished version of the DAWGCHECK Trainer (1:1 replica). It includes:
- Dynamic Product dropdown (state + product type)
- Live premium quoting (age, coverage, riders)
- Autosave/restore (localStorage)
- Stepper, validation, accessibility improvements
- PWA manifest and service worker for offline/installed experience
- Print-to-PDF button and admin reset helper

Files added/updated:
- `index.html` — improved markup, ARIA attributes, references to icons
- `app.js` — full application logic (dynamic products, quoting, autosave)
- `styles.css` — final polished styles and responsiveness
- `manifest.json` — PWA metadata
- `service-worker.js` — cache-first service worker
- `assets/` — make sure icons and `city.jpg` exist

How to create a new branch, commit these changes and push:
1. From your repo root:
   - git checkout -b feature/production-replica
2. Replace the files in the working tree with the provided files (copy/paste).
3. Commit:
   - git add index.html app.js styles.css manifest.json service-worker.js README.md
   - git commit -m "feat: production-ready DAWGCHECK Trainer — dynamic products, live quoting, PWA"
4. Push:
   - git push origin feature/production-replica
5. Create a PR on GitHub (you can use the UI or `gh` CLI):
   - gh pr create --base main --head feature/production-replica --title "Production-ready Trainer" --body "Full replica with dynamic products, live quoting, autosave, PWA."

Local testing:
- Serve locally from a simple static server (e.g., `npx http-server` or `python -m http.server 8080`) and open in browser.
- Test PWA install flow and service worker in Chrome DevTools -> Application -> Service Workers.

Publishing to Google Play (PWA -> Android):
- For a clean Play listing wrap as a Trusted Web Activity (TWA) using Bubblewrap (https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/bubblewrap).
- Or use PWABuilder (https://www.pwabuilder.com/) to create an Android package.
- Ensure icons and manifest are set; provide privacy policy URL and store listing images.

Notes & next actions:
- Replace placeholder images in `assets/icons/` (icon-192.png / icon-512.png) with final brand assets.
- Optionally wire a backend API for real quoting; the client-side simulation can be replaced by a `fetch()` call in `calculatePremium`.
- If you'd like, I can prepare a PR patch (diff) for you or open a draft PR — I need repository push permissions to do that automatically.
